### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Chris, a Junior IOS developer currently studying Software Engineering at UVU. I have experience with Python, Swift and building mobile applications. I'm working on securing an internship or Junior developer role either in Utah or remote. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an application for my university that will allow students to rate courses on various subjects. Planning to tie it into ratemyprofessor.com.  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Swift, Python and all the nuances of Xcode 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Email is the best, withscottc921@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am technically a cyborg, I had a machine implanted in my body!
